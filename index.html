            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>I am friendly, caring and hardworking. Yet, I am simultaneously stubborn and opinionated. I love and am extremely loyal to my family and friends.</p>

            <p>Honesty and loyalty are important to me. I will work my ass off for someone, but it is nice to be appreciated. Kindness, love, and understanding for others is important to me. I also value a good education and the constant need to learn.</p>

            <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>

            <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are: Tennis (I played in college, and continue to play), as well as psychology, movies, books, and ping pong. I also like playing around with new technology.</p>

            <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>

            <p>My dream job varies depending on the day, in terms of web design, or programming, it would be to have a job where I would create programs that would help students obtain materials at a free or at least extremely affordable price (textbooks, adaptive questioning materials). Pretty much the same stuff that educational websites are making students pay 100s of dollars for I would like to be able to do at an affordable rate. And simultaneously get paid to do so, would be sweet.</p>

            <h3>What's your favorite type of music?</h3>

            <p>In terms of music, I like just about anything. More recently I have enjoyed the song “Here” by Alessia Cara. But ask me tomorrow and it will be different.</p>
